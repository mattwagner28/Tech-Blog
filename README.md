# Tech-Blog

## Description
For a coding boocamp assignment, we had to build a basic blog from scratch, linking front end and back end, so that when a user logged in they could post, delete, or edit their own blogs, and see the posts of others.

## Short comings
Due to limited time because of life events, I did not have time to completely build this out. The user can, however, create a username and encrypted password, view all blog posts stored in the database, and post their own blog that is also stored in the database.
